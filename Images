I have provided some example images you can download and try out for yourself.
You will need to make sure to have these images in the same folder as the .py file.
Once you are ready to use the program make sure to put the name of the image file exact.
For example:
When you are prompted which image you want to turn into a sketch, you will type out "Car.jpg" then press enter.

You can do the above for any image I have provided or ones you have added to your project. Have fun turning everything into a sketch!

These images are all royalty free I am providing the original owners if you wish to check them out.
